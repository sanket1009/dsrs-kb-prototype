**What’s inside**  
Prototype KB (`dsrs_kb_source.csv`), a NetworkX graph converted to an
interactive PyVis HTML (`dsrs_graph.html`), and a fully-reproducible notebook
(`DSRS_KB_Prototype.ipynb`).

**How to run**

1. Open `DSRS_KB_Prototype.ipynb` and run *Runtime ▸ Run all*  
2. When execution finishes, double-click `dsrs_graph.html` in the file browser
   to explore the graph.
